Below some sites that I thought were useful for making my website:

### Github & Shiny
This website was 'forked' from [https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

For some cool features (particularly the [shiny-apps-page](https://gertstulp.github.io/pages/shiny/)), I have had a close look at Dean Attali's [website]((http://deanattali.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server).

I also learned more from RStudio's [shiny examples](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples).

### HTML

This is useful for testing features of HTML: [http://jsfiddle.net/kyagn39h/12/](http://jsfiddle.net/kyagn39h/12/),  [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/), [http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import), [https://medium.com/@jamesfuthey/simulating-the-creation-of-website-thumbnail-screenshots-using-iframes-7145269891db](https://medium.com/@jamesfuthey/simulating-the-creation-of-website-thumbnail-screenshots-using-iframes-7145269891db) and [http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-3-column.htm](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-3-column.htm).
