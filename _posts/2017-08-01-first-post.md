My first blog. So weird. I am only writing this to myself. Why, then, not keep my nonsense to myself? Indeed. 

For future reference:
This website was 'forked' from https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll, and made by Dean Attali who is infinitely awesome. 

This style of website (based on Jekyll) is particularly good for blogging, so I later learned. Given that I probably won't really do that, I don't know if this was a wise choice. Perhaps I should have gone for [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) or for some [Rmarkdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). I say this particularly in the light of the fact that the current set up does not seem to work very smoothly with Rmarkdown files. It is pretty though, so I'll probably keep it.
